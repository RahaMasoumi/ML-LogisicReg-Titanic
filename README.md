# ML-LogisicReg-Titanic
This is the second exercise that I have done during the course for "Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" in Udemy.
In this code we are working with the Titanic Data Set from Kaggle. we will try to predict survival or deceased for the passagners who have been in Titanic ship. For this classification we have used the Logistic Regression algorithm
